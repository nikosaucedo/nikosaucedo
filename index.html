    <h2 class="w3-theme">About Me</h2>
    <p class="w3-text-theme">Hello, my name is <strong>
      <button class="w3-button w3-pink w3-round-large">Niko Saucedo</button>
      </strong>. I'm 22 years old and was born here in the Dallas area and have grown up here as well. I've been attending mostly online class and have gone to a couple of classes in person at the North Lake Campus in Irving. I currently studying to get my Associate's Degree in <strong>Digital Art and Design</strong>.</p>
    <p class="w3-text-theme">Originally, right out high school, I wanted to get my real estate license and pursue real estate. Unfortunately, I got my real estate license right when Covid-19 happened, so nobody was wanting to buy or sell their home. So this discouraged me at the time since their was no business happening around me, so I decided to start community college. I decided to pursue my Associate's Degree in Digital Art and Design, and this will be my last class I need before I graduate. I hope to get a remote job where I can travel and work from anywhere around the world.</p>

    <h2 class="w3-theme">What I Learned in This Class</h2>
    <p class="w3-text-theme">I learned a lot in this class and it mainly helped with touching up on HTML and CSS that I had some knowledge of but also with things that I didn't know about. I learned about flexbox which was an interesting an easy way to organize and contain items on your page. Along with that, learning about W3.CSS, which I had no idea about, was a very easy and in depth way of adding styles, themes, and more advanced changes to your site with minimal effort and coding, which I enjoyed.</p>

    <p class="w3-text-theme">Before this class, I had minimal knowledge of WordPress and thought it was very confusing and struggled a lot with it. I think this class helped introduce me to WordPress simply and understandably, which I enjoyed very much because the career I'm hoping to go into will be using WordPress quite a bit along with having the general knowledge of HTML and CSS which is always useful in the field I'm looking to go into. </p>

    <p class="w3-text-theme">One of my main goals in life is to visit every country in the world. I know this will take a very long time and cost a lot of money, but I've always been interested in all the different cultures and ways of life aroung the world that are much different from ours here in America. I think this intrest started when I was young because of my interest in different languages. Growing up in Texas, you mainly hear English spoken but you also meet many people from diverse backgrounds and cultures, and having friends that spoke different languages with their families, I always thought it was very intriguing that people spoke and used sounds that are confusing and unknown to others but still conveyed the same message we would used to others in English. I find it hard to find the time to study different languages but currently, I understand most spoken Spanish (althought I'm not as confident in my speaking ability), and I'm learning Korean, and German. </p>
